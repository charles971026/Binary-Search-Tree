# Binary-Search-Tree
Each parent node has two child nodes; left node and right node.
If an input data is smaller than its parent node, it gets stored to the left node of the parent node. Otherwise, it gets stored to the right node of the parent node.
The input data continously gets compared until it gets to the bottom of the tree.
